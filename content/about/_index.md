Hi! I'm Guillem, though you'll mostly see me as 'mechie' online.

Currently I'm enjoying playing with C#, Python, and Rust. Outside of coding, I've been having a go at weightlifting, driving, and spoiling Caliu rotten.

If you need to get in touch, [twitter] or [e-mail] are your best bet.

        style="border-radius: 8px; width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto",
        caption="Fig. 1: A spoiled Caliu."
    )
}}
